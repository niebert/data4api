# Retrieve Data from an API for R Analysis
This is a repository with scripts that show how to use a remote API for data retrieval. The sources are mainly R but also some small scripts are available to show the basic principles from the Linux shell.

## Introduction
This repository was establish during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/COVID-19) for a learning resource in Wikiversity  about [Dynamic Report or Report Generation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Dynamic_Document_Generation) with [KnitR](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/KnitR)

## Folders
The following folders are providing tools for data retrieval on the Operating System level or on the application level (e.g. in [Open Source R]()

### Linux - Shell Scripts
The folder `linux` contains Linux scripts that can be used for automatisation of data updates. These scripts are usually added in the [crontab](https://linuxhandbook.com/crontab/) for daily or weekly update of data.
